`The Automatic Topological Generator for Framework Structures <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp507643v>`_ is a software for the design ang high throughput generation of framework structures such as Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Zeolites, Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COFs), or any product of reticular chemistry. The underlying library for chemical objects makes extensive use of the :ref:`ASE <ASE>` environment shipped with the Amsterdam Modeling Suite.

AuToGraFS was developed in the group of Prof. Dr. Heine at  Jacobs University Bremen by Dr. M. Addicoat and D. Coupry. While a console application is `available <https://github.com/maddicoat/AuToGraFS>`_ under a GNU LGPL license, the version shipped together with the Amsterdam Modeling Suite was heavily modified into a fully importable python library for easy scripting capabilities. The software was also fully integrated into the GUI, and some native functions were developed for added functionality in this particular environment. A database of building units often used in existing MOFs is also provided, to cover basic needs.

The rest of this section is dedicated to a documentation and a demonstration of the usage of both the scripting capabilities and GUI tools from the Automatic Topological Generator for Framework Structures.
