VCD Analysis: VCDtools
**********************

The auxiliary program *VCDtools* provides insight regarding the origin of the VCD intensity of a given normal mode. This is done by analyzing and visualizing the various contributions to the total Electric (E) and Magnetic (M) Dipole Transition Moments (DTM). *e.g.*, the contributions from atoms, electrons, nuclei and molecular fragments. 
The *VCDtools* program is accessible through the AMS-GUI.
Documentation can be found in:

* `VCDtools section of the AMS manual <../../AMS/Utilities/VCDtools.html>`__.
