Warnings
========

The program attempts to detect bugs, instabilities, convergence problems, et cetera and may issue warnings when something looks suspicious. This is not necessarily fatal to your results, but you should be cautious and try to understand what the messages are about. Most warnings are printed in the logfile. Usually there is corresponding and more extensive information in the standard output file.
