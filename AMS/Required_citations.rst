.. index:: Required citations

General references
------------------

When you publish results in the scientific literature that were obtained
through the AMS driver program, you are required to include a reference to the
program package with the appropriate release number:

AMS |release|, SCM, Theoretical Chemistry, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, `http://www.scm.com <http://www.scm.com>`__. Optionally, you may add the following list of authors and contributors: R. Rüger, M. Franchini, T. Trnka, A. Yakovlev, E. van Lenthe, P. Philipsen, T. van Vuren, B. Klumpers, T. Soini

The engine used for a particular calculation might require you to
include other references. Please refer to the specific :ref:`engine
manuals<available_engines>` for required citations.

In addition to these general references, certain AMS features require
additional citations, in case you have used them. An overview of these is given
in the `Feature references` section below.

.. note::

   If you have used a modified (by yourself, for instance) version of the code,
   you should mention in the citation that a modified version has been used.
