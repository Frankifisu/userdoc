.. index:: Input for AMS

Input
=====

The input for AMS has a block and keyword structure.
See the :ref:`input_syntax` section for more details.

The input keys :ref:`System<SystemDefinition>`, :ref:`Task<keyTask>`, and :ref:`Engine<Engines>`, are obligatory.
Most other input keys in AMS are optional, like :ref:`Properties<keyProperties>`. 
In the rest of this manual one can find all input keys for AMS.

The Engine specific input can be found in the respective Engine Manuals, for example, the manual for
`ADF <../ADF/index.html>`__, `BAND <../BAND/index.html>`__, `DFTB <../DFTB/index.html>`__, `ForceField <../ForceField/index.html>`__, `MOPAC <../MOPAC/index.html>`__, and `ReaxFF <../ReaxFF/ReaxFFEngine.html>`__.

Example
-------

The AMS input has a special ``Engine`` block, that selects which engine is used for
the simulation and also contains all the details of its configuration. This is
probably best illustrated by an example. Let us look at the following AMS
input, which optimizes the geometry of the methane molecule and calculates its
normal modes of vibration at the optimized geometry:

.. code-block:: shell

   $AMSBIN/ams << EOF
      Task GeometryOptimization

      GeometryOptimization
         Convergence
            Gradients 1.0e-4
         End
      End

      Properties
         NormalModes true
      End

      System
         Atoms
            C       0.00000000       0.00000000       0.00000000
            H       0.63294000      -0.63294000      -0.63294000
            H      -0.63294000       0.63294000      -0.63294000
            H       0.63294000       0.63294000       0.63294000
            H      -0.63294000      -0.63294000       0.63294000
         End
      End

      Engine DFTB
          Model DFTB3
          ResourcesDir DFTB.org/3ob-3-1
      EndEngine
   EOF

Note how DFTB is selected as the engine in the ``Engine DFTB`` line that opens
the ``Engine`` block. All DFTB specific configuration is contained within this
engine block, which is terminated by ``EndEngine``. The fact that we want to run
a geometry optimization with normal modes for methane and things like
convergence criteria for the optimization are of course completely independent
from which engine is actually used to perform this calculation. Therefore they
are all found *outside* of the ``Engine`` block. In this sense, the AMS input is
split up into the driver level input (everything outside of the engine block)
and the engine input, which is just a single ``Engine`` block. This separation
makes it easy to perform the same calculation at a different level of theory, by
simply switching out the ``Engine`` block in the input. We could, for example,
repeat the same calculation at the DFT-GGA level using the Band engine:

.. code-block:: none

   Engine BAND
       XC
          GGA PBE
       End
   EndEngine

Engines like ADF or BAND that have many options and can calculate many properties,
consequently also have a large number of possible keywords in their input. In
order to have a better structured documentation we have split off the description
of the engine inputs into separate :ref:`engine specific manuals<engines>`,
while this AMS manual only documents the driver level keywords outside of the
``Engine`` block. All the engine specific options are found in the respective
engine's manual, which documents the keywords in its ``Engine`` block. In
general all engines can be used with all tasks in AMS. There are only a few
rather obvious restrictions, for example that only engines which can handle
periodic systems can be used for the calculation of phonons.

.. index:: Running AMS

Execution
=========

Shell script
------------

The AMS driver reads its input from standard input, i.e. what is called
``STDIN`` on Unix-like systems. Technically it is possible to run AMS and type
the input file in interactively. This is however highly impractical and most
people run AMS from a small shell script that contains the AMS text input and
sends it directly to the AMS executable.
For example, the content of the file 'example.run' could be like:

.. code-block:: shell

   #!/bin/sh

   $AMSBIN/ams << EOF

      ... AMS text input goes here:

      Block
         Keywork value
         OtherKeyword value
      End

   EOF

The shell script 'example.run' needs be executable, if it isn't you will need to make it executable, e.g. ``chmod u+x example.run``.
The 'example.run' file needs to be executed as a shell script, not as input to AMS.

``./example.run > example.out``

.. _interactive_input_file:

Interactive input file
----------------------

As of the 2021.1 version the AMS driver has the concept of an interactive input file.
The interactive input file is a second input file, that users may create in the :ref:`results directory <results_directory>` of an already running job to interact with it.
The name of the interactive input file is ``interactive.in``.
Note that the file does not exist by default, but has to be created by the user wanting to interact with the running AMS job.

In AMS2021.1 the interactive input file may be used to request the graceful and orderly termination of a job.

.. code::

   echo "Stop" > ams.results/interactive.in

.. scmautodoc:: ams_interactive Stop
   :nosummary:

It is generally preferably to request the termination through the interactive input file over killing a job at the operating system level.
This makes sure that the job stops at a logical point and still has time to write intermediate results to disk, making restarting from such jobs easier and more reliable.
From the graphical user interface, the stopping can be requested in AMSjobs by selecting the running job and clicking **Job â†’ Request Early Stop** in the menu bar.

As of AMS2021.1, the tasks that can be stopped through the interactive input file are:

- :ref:`Molecular dynamics<MolecularDynamics>` simulations will stop at the next sampling or checkpoint as if the maximum number of steps had been reached.
- :ref:`Geometry optimizations<GeometryOptimization>` will stop after the current iteration and be considered converged. This can be used if a geometry optimization does not make progress anymore, e.g. because the convergence thresholds are set tighter than the noise level of the used engine.
- :ref:`Nudged elastic band<NEB>` calculations will stop after the current iteration (i.e. the calculations for all images) is complete.
- :ref:`PES scans<PESScan>` will interrupt the currently running geometry optimization and skip the optimization for all further PES points.
- :ref:`PES explorations<EON>` will terminate after the currently running expedition. No new explorers will be dispatched, but currently active explorers will be allowed to finish.


Note that the ``Stop`` keyword in the interactive input file will not interrupt the job in the middle of the numerical calculation of a :ref:`PES point property<PESPointExtraProperties>`, such as a Hessian or stress tensor.
It will also never stop a job that is currently running an engine, and will hence not stop an engine that is calculating these properties analytically.
It is possible to interrupt the numerical calculation of :ref:`PES point properties<PESPointExtraProperties>` using the ``StopProperties`` keyword.
We advise users to be careful with this keyword and always combine it with the ``Stop`` keyword, as it is generally not possible to skip the evaluation of properties, but continue with a task as the AMS driver level.
(After all, the driver may need the properties that we interrupt.)

.. code::

   echo "Stop" > ams.results/interactive.in
   echo "StopProperties" >> ams.results/interactive.in

.. scmautodoc:: ams_interactive StopProperties
   :nosummary:

As of AMS2021.1 it is not possible to restart the calculation of properties that were interrupted like this. Hence the use of the ``StopProperties`` keyword is limited.


.. _running_on_clusters:
.. index:: Compute clusters

Running AMS on compute clusters
-------------------------------

AMS is parallelized with MPI and can therefore be run in parallel on distributed
memory machines, aka compute clusters. See the `installation manual
<../Installation/Additional_Information_and_Known_Issues.html#running-mpi-jobs>`__
for general documentation on how to set up and run all the programs from the
Amsterdam Modeling Suite on compute clusters. In this section we give some more
advice that is specific to the AMS driver and its engines.

Normally users use the login node to prepare their jobs and input files
somewhere in their home directory, and also want the results of their jobs to
end up there. Quite often, compute clusters are set up such that the user's home
directory is also mounted on the compute nodes, usually via NFS (Network File
System). Before the introduction of the AMS driver it was not recommended to
``cd`` to the home directory in the submission script and have the compute nodes
execute the job directly there. This was simply due to the fact that a lot of
file I/O was done on temporary files in the present working directory, which in
this case would be on a slow network-mounted file system.

On the other hand, with AMS, switching to the home directory is the preferred
way of running on a cluster where the home directory is mounted on the compute
nodes. Running in the home directory mounted over NFS does not come with a
performance penalty for AMS, but has many advantages. This is because AMS and
its engines are already built under the assumption that access to this directory
is slow. Basically there are three directories that are used by the AMS driver
and its engines:

.. index:: Starting directory

1. The **starting directory**, i.e. the present working directory at the time
   the AMS driver is started. This folder is generally read-only for AMS, except
   for creating the results directory there at the beginning of a calculation.
   Note that all relative paths in the AMS input, e.g. for loading results from
   previous calculations, are relative to the starting directory.  The starting
   directory is assumed to be on a slow filesystem, but since data is normally
   only read once from there in the beginning of a calculation, this is in
   practice not a problem.

.. index:: Results directory

2. The **results directory**, where the results of a calculation as well as
   important intermediate steps (e.g. restart files) are collected. It also
   contains the log file which can be used to monitor a running calculations.
   The results directory is assumed to be on a slow filesystem, so AMS and its
   engines will be very careful not to do much disk I/O there. Generally
   something is only written to the results directory when AMS is sure that it
   should remain on disk when the calculation finishes. The results directory
   can also contain some intermediate restart files, so the contents of the
   result directory should be all that is needed in case the calculation crashes
   or is killed before it finishes normally.

.. index:: Scratch directory
.. index:: Temporary directory
.. index:: SCM_TMPDIR

3. The **scratch directory**, the location of which is set with the
   ``$SCM_TMPDIR`` environment variable, see also the `installation manual
   <../Installation/Appendix_A_Environment_Variables.html#more-on-the-scm-tmpdir-variable>`__.
   This directory should be put on a fast disk, e.g. an SSD in the compute node,
   as it will be used to store temporary results on disk. Users do not really
   need to care or know about the temporary files in the scratch directory.
   Normally, any files and directories created in the scratch directory are
   cleaned up at the end of the calculation. In case of errors, AMS tries to
   copy anything useful (e.g. the text output of all the different ranks) to the
   results directory in order to make finding the problem easier. However, for
   some kinds of crashes (or if the ``SIGKILL`` signal is sent to AMS), the
   cleanup of the scratch directory might not be performed, in which case users
   might want to manually check or remove the ``amstmp_*`` folders in the
   scratch directory.

With this setup there is no performance penalty for running directly on a
network mounted home directory: Results will just be put there immediately,
instead of being copied there at the end of a calculation.

Normally all batch systems provide an environment variable that is set to the
directory from which the job was submitted, which is then where one should
``cd`` in the run script:

.. code-block:: shell

   #!/bin/sh

   if [ -z "$PBS_O_WORKDIR" ]; then
      # PBS batch system
      cd "$PBS_O_WORKDIR"
   elif [ -z "$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR" ]; then
      # Slurm batch system
      cd "$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR"
   elif [ -z "..." ]; then
      # add other batch systems as necessary ...
      cd "..."
   fi

   export AMS_JOBNAME=myJob

   $AMSBIN/ams << EOF

      # Normal AMS text input, but with all paths
      # relative to where the job was submitted from, e.g.:
      LoadSystem previousJob.results/ams.rkf

   EOF

With this runscript the AMS driver would make a ``myJob.results`` folder in the
directory where the job was submitted from, and there is no need to copy results
around manually in the run script. Furthermore this runscript always produces
exactly the same files in the same locations, no matter if it is run
interactively or submitted to a compute node through the batch system.
Furthermore all paths in the input file can be specified relative to the
location from where the runscript is submitted (normally the folder in which the
runscript is located). This removes the need to copy or specify absolute paths
to previous results, e.g. when restarting calculations. Finally, files useful
for monitoring the running calculation are also conveniently there and not
hidden somewhere on the compute node.


.. _AMS_output:
.. index:: Output of AMS

Output
======

AMS produces two ASCII files: standard output and the ``ams.log`` file, and produces several binary output data files.
The ``ams.log`` file is a very concise summary of the calculation's progress during the run.
The binary output data files contain job characteristics and computational results produced by AMS and the Engine.
Part of what is written to the binary output files is also written in a human readable form to standard output.

.. _results_directory:
.. index:: Results directory

Results directory
-----------------

Note that AMS does not put any of its binary output files and the ``ams.log`` file
into the present working directory, as virtually all of the standalone programs
in the suite did. Instead AMS creates a ``*.results`` directory, which collects
all result file associated with a job. Here ``*`` is replaced by the jobname,
which is set with the ``AMS_JOBNAME`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

   AMS_JOBNAME=methane $AMSBIN/ams << EOF

      ... see Input example before ...

   EOF

This would put all results related to our geometry optimization of methane into
the newly created folder ``methane.results``. (The default name of the results
folder is ``ams.results`` if ``AMS_JOBNAME`` is not set, see the
:ref:`environment variables<EnvironmentVariables>` section of this manual for
documentation of all environment variables used by AMS.) In this way users can
easily run multiple jobs in the same directory without danger of clashing output
files, which was a common problem before the introduction of AMS. This new setup
is also more consistent with the graphical user interface, which already
collected all files associated with a specific job into a dedicated results
directory. Note that AMS will by default **not overwrite** results directories if a
job is rerun or another job is run with the same jobname.

.. index:: Logfile ams.log
.. index:: ams.log

Logfile ams.log
---------------

Inside of the results directory users will always find the logfile ``ams.log``,
which is written during a running calculation and can be used to monitor its
progress.

The logfile ``ams.log`` is generated during the calculation and flushed after (almost) each message that is sent to it by the program.
Consequently, the user can inspect it and see what is going on without being delayed by potentially large system I/O buffers.
Each message contains date and time of the message plus additional info.

Be alert on error messages.  Take them seriously: inspect the standard output carefully and try to understand what has gone wrong.
Be also alert to warnings.
They are not necessarily fatal but you should understand what they are about before being satisfied with the results of the calculation.
Do not ignore them just because the program has not aborted: in some cases the program may not be able to determine whether or not you really want to do what appears to be wrong or suspicious.
If you believe that the program displays erratic behavior, then the standard output file may contain more detailed information.
Therefore, in such case save the complete standard output file, together with the logfile ``ams.log``, in case we need these files for further analysis.

.. index:: Output files
.. index:: Binary output files

Binary output files
-------------------

The results directory contains binary result files in the
KF format, which can be opened and inspected with the KFBrowser GUI component.
KF stands for Keyed File: KF files are keyword oriented, which makes them easy to process by simple procedures.
KF files are Direct Access binary files.

.. _main_output_file:
.. index:: ams.rkf

* The main ``ams.rkf`` written by the AMS driver. It contains high level
  information about the trajectory that the AMS driver took over the potential
  energy surface. For a geometry optimization it would for example contains the
  history of how the systems geometry changed during the optimization as well as
  the final optimized geometry. For a molecular dynamics simulation it would
  contain the full trajectory. The format in which this information is written
  is independent from which engine was used for a calculation.

.. _engine_output_files:
.. index:: Engine output files

* The engine specific main binary output file written by the engine (and partly by the AMS driver).
  This file is kept for only one special point, e.g. the final geometry in a geometry optimization.
  The ADF engine writes ``adf.rkf`` (instead of ``TAPE21`` in older versions). The BAND engine writes
  band.rkf (instead of ``RUNKF`` in older versions). The DFTB engine writes ``dftb.rkf``.
  If a property, like vibrational modes, is tied to this special point on the potential energy surface,
  it is stored in this file.
  Also all engine specific properties are written to the main binary output file, like orbitals
  in case of a quantum mechanical engine.

  .. csv-table:: Engine specific main binary output file
     :widths: 50,50

     **Engine**,**main file**
     ADF,adf.rkf
     BAND,band.rkf
     DFTB,dftb.rkf
     ForceField,forcefield.rkf
     MOPAC,mopac.rkf
     ReaxFF,reaxff.rkf
     External,external.rkf

* Additionally there might be an engine specific binary output file for every point on the
  potential energy surface that was visited during the calculation.
  Like the engine specific main binary output file they contain
  information tied to a specific point on the potential energy surface.
  These engine output files all have the extension ``.rkf``, but their
  filename is usually somehow descriptive of the point on the PES that they
  correspond to. Note that one does not always get an engine output file for
  every PES point that was visited during the calculation. For most applications
  this would just be too much data.

* Other engine specific binary (and ASCII) output files written by the engine.

Having multiple different binary output files could be confusing for people that
are used to the single result file that was written by the standalone programs
in ADF<=2017. After all, it brings up the question in which file the desired
property is stored. The general rule is: If the property is tied to a particular
point on the potential energy surface, it is stored in the engine output file
belonging to that particular point.
This includes the Hessian, stress tensor, elastic tensor, normal modes of vibration, phonons,
Raman intensities and other vibrational properties.
If the information depends on the entire trajectory over the PES, it is found in
the main ``ams.rkf`` written by the AMS driver.


Standard output
---------------

The standard ouput file contains in a human readable form
part of the job characteristics and computational results produced by AMS and the Engine.


Optimized geometry in xyz format
--------------------------------

In case of :ref:`Geometry Optimizations<GeometryOptimization>`, the optimized geometry is saved as an :ref:`extended XYZ file<ExtendedXYZ>` in the results directory with the name ``output.xyz``.

Note that the optimized geometry is also stored in the binary file ``ams.rkf`` and is printed to the standard output.


.. _EnvironmentVariables:
.. index:: Environment variables

AMS environment variables
-------------------------

The behavior of AMS related to the output can be modified through a number of environment variables.

.. index:: Job name
.. index:: AMS_JOBNAME

``AMS_JOBNAME``
   Sets the name of a job. This name is used to determine the name of the
   results folder AMS creates, which is ``$AMS_JOBNAME.results`` or
   ``ams.results`` if this environment variable is not set.

.. index:: AMS_RESULTSDIR

``AMS_RESULTSDIR``
   If this environment variable is set, instead of creating a new results
   folder, AMS will use the set directory as the results folder. Not that the
   directory set here will *not* be created by AMS and therefore has to exist
   before starting AMS. Note that this environment variable can be used to
   prevent AMS from creating result folders, by setting ``AMS_RESULTSDIR=.``.
   This reproduces the pre-AMS behavior of putting all result files into the
   directory from which a job is started.

.. index:: AMS_SWITCH_LOGFILE_AND_STDOUT

``AMS_SWITCH_LOGFILE_AND_STDOUT``
   If this environment variable is set, AMS will redirect what is normally
   printed on standard output to a file (``ams.out``) in the results directory.
   Instead the contents of the log file (``ams.log``) will be printed to
   standard output while a job is running, allowing users to easily monitor the
   jobs progress. Note that the log file will still be created normally as if
   this environment variable was not set. This environment variable is just a
   convenience feature for users that would always redirect their output into a
   file and then use ``tail -f`` on the log file to monitor the running
   calculation.

This is an example run-script using the ``AMS_SWITCH_LOGFILE_AND_STDOUT`` and ``AMS_JOBNAME`` environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/sh

   # By setting AMS_SWITCH_LOGFILE_AND_STDOUT, the (more compact) 
   # logfile will be printed to standard output while the full 
   # text output of the calculation is redirected to the file 
   # ams.out in the ams results folder

   export AMS_SWITCH_LOGFILE_AND_STDOUT=true

   # By default ams creates a folder 'ams.results' and puts the
   # results of the calculation there. If we set AMS_JOBNAME, the
   # results folder will instead be called $AMS_JOBNAME.results 
   # (in this case, 'H2_optimization.results')

.. _DriverLevelParallelism:

Driver level parallelism
========================

.. seealso::

  See also the `GUI tutorial <../Tutorials/OptimizingPerformance/ParallelElasticTensor.html>`__ on the parallel scalability of the calculation of elastic tensors.

AMS is a parallel program using MPI for efficient execution on distributed
memory machines, aka compute clusters. For most jobs, the AMS driver part of a
calculation is computationally not particularly costly and most of the execution
time is spent inside of the :ref:`compute engines<Engines>`. Therefore the main
parallelization of AMS is inside of the engines, making sure that a good
performance is obtained for :ref:`tasks<Tasks>` such as :ref:`molecular
dynamics<MolecularDynamics>` or :ref:`geometry
optimizations<GeometryOptimization>`, which consist of a series of
interdependent engine invocations: We need to have completed step :math:`n`
before we can continue with step :math:`n+1`.

However, not all workloads are of this sequentially dependent type. Some jobs
have a lot of independent work, that can be done in parallel. This kind of
trivial parallelizability can be exploited at the AMS driver level: Instead of
having all cores collaborate on a single PES point and then doing all needed
PES points sequentially, we can just distribute the available PES points over
the all the available cores. Normally this leads to a better parallel scaling
than the default parallelization inside of the engines: Parallelizing the
engines is relatively complicated and often requires a lot of communication
between cores.  Parallelizing on the driver level on the other hand is very
easy, and often the only communication required is at the very end of the
calculation, when results are collected.

Note that it is perfectly possible to combine both the in-engine
parallelization and the driver level parallelism: At the driver level we could
split our e.g. in total 32 cores into 4 groups of 8 cores, and then have each
group of 8 use the in-engine parallelization to collaborate on a specific
calculation. This is especially useful if the total number of cores is larger
than then number of independent calculations we have to do. It might also be
that we have a very large number of calculations to do, but not enough memory
to let every core work alone on its own calculation, as would be ideal from a
parallel scaling point of view.

Because of the two levels of parallelism -- both at the driver and the engine
level -- we call this setup **double parallelization**.

**Starting with the AMS2019.3 release, driver level parallelism is used and
configured automatically. That means that the AMS driver will automatically
parallelize at the driver level when it is possible and considered
advantageous. As such it should normally not be necessary for users to
explicitly configure the driver level parallelism.**

Driver level parallelism can be used for the calculation of the :ref:`PES point
properties<PESPointProperties>` which are derivatives, if these need to be done
numerically:

* Numerical calculation of :ref:`forces / nuclear gradients<NuclearGradients>`.
  With a double sided derivative this requires :math:`6 \times n_\text{atoms}`
  independent calculations on geometries with one atom displaced along a
  cartesian coordinate.

* Numerical calculation of the :ref:`stress tensor<StressTensor>` for periodic
  systems. This requires up to 12 calculations for a double sided derivative
  along the 6 strain directions, but might require less in case some of the
  strains are symmetry equivalent.

* Numerical calculation of the :ref:`Hessian<Hessian>` and normal modes of
  vibration. This is currently only supported for engines that calculate nuclear
  gradients analytically and done by numerically differentiating this first
  (analytic) derivative. As such it requires :math:`6 \times n_\text{atoms}`
  independent calculations on geometries with one atom displaced along a
  cartesian coordinate.

* Numerical calculation of the :ref:`elastic tensor<ElasticTensor>`. This
  requires 84 independent geometry optimizations on systems with differently
  strained lattices, with each optimization having a variable number of steps.

* Numerical calculation of :ref:`phonons<Phonons>`. This requires at most
  :math:`6 \times n_\text{atoms}` displacements, but might require less in case
  some of the displacements are symmetry equivalent. Note that the displacements
  are done in a super cell system, which for many engines will increase the
  memory requirements, but also improve the in-engine parallel scalability.

* The forward and backward displacements along normal modes for the
  :ref:`Mode Scanning<ModeScanning>`, :ref:`Mode Refinement<ModeRefinement>`,
  and :ref:`Mode Tracking<ModeTracking>`.

There are also tasks using driver level parallelism, e.g. :ref:`Nudged Elastic
Band<NEB>`, for which the calculations of all the images is trivially parallel.

Details of the driver level parallelism, i.e. how much to parallelize at the
driver level, are generally configured for the above mentioned cases on an
individual basis, because one might want a different grouping strategy for each
case. For each case there is a separate ``Parallel`` block somewhere in the
input (e.g. ``ElasticTensor%Parallel`` for the calculation of the elastic
tensor), which has the following keywords::

   Parallel
      nGroups integer
      nCoresPerGroup integer
      nNodesPerGroup integer
   End

Note that only one of them should be specified in the input, depending of course
on what is the desired strategy for parallelization.

``nGroups n``
   Splits all cores evenly into ``n`` groups. We recommend choosing ``n`` such
   that it divides the total number of cores without a remainder.

``nCoresPerGroup n``
   Each group consists of ``n`` cores. As such ``nCoresPerGroup 1`` results in
   the maximum possible parallelism at the driver level. We recommend choosing
   ``n`` such that it divides the total number of cores without a remainder.

``nNodesPerGroup n``
   Makes groups from all cores within ``n`` nodes, e.g. ``nNodesPerGroup 1``
   would make every cluster node into a separate group. Note that this option
   should *only be used on homogeneous compute clusters*, where all used nodes
   have the same number of cores. Otherwise cores from different nodes will be
   grouped together in very surprising and unintended ways, probably resulting
   in suboptimal performance.

The optimal grouping strategy and number of groups depends on the total number
of cores used in the calculation, the amount of independent tasks to be done in
parallel, as well as the parallel scalability of the engine itself. In practice
it can be a bit tricky, which is why the grouping strategy is determined
automatically since AMS2019.3.

However, sometimes it can be useful to configure the groups manually. Suppose,
as an example, that we want to calculate the elastic properties of a bulk
material on a 32 core machine. The calculation of the :ref:`elastic
tensor<ElasticTensor>` should be done on a relaxed geometry, including relaxed
lattice degrees of freedom. We therefore first perform a geometry optimization,
before calculating the elastic tensor. In AMS this can easily be done with the
following input::

   Task GeometryOptimization

   GeometryOptimization
      OptimizeLattice True
   End

   Properties
      ElasticTensor True
   End

But what is the most optimal parallel setup for this calculation? First we
recognize that performing a lattice optimization requires the calculation of the
:ref:`stress tensor<StressTensor>` at every step of the optimization. Assuming
that our bulk system does not have any symmetries AMS can exploit, the numerical
calculation of the stress tensor (assuming the engine can not calculate it
analytically) would require 12 independent strained calculations for every step
in the geometry optimization. Once the geometry optimization is converged, we
have to perform 84 independent geometry optimizations to determine the elements
of the elastic tensor. In summary, the graph of dependencies between all these
tasks looks like this:

.. image:: images/double_parallelism.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

How do we best parallelize this? For the main steps, e.g. ``GOStep1`` there is
no question: We have nothing to do in parallel and all 32 cores work on it
together to finish it as quickly as possible. For the numerical calculation of
the stress tensor we have 12 tasks that can be done in parallel by the 32 cores
in our machine. Now 12 obviously does not divide 32 without a remainder, so
there is no way to split into equally sized groups and do all 12 strains in
parallel. The greatest common divisor of 12 and 32 is 4, so it's probably best
to split into 4 groups of 8 cores each. This is done with ``nGroups 4``. Each
group would then do 3 of the 12 strained calculations sequentially, using the
in-engine parallelization to speed up the individual calculations. Once the
stress tensor is computed in this way all groups merge and all 32 cores work
together on ``GOStep2``. This splitting and merging now continues until the
geometry optimization is converged. For the elastic tensor we now have 84 tasks
to perform in parallel, where each task is a completely separate geometry
optimization (without optimizing the lattice) of a strained system. 84 tasks is
more than double the number of cores we have. In this case it is probably not
too bad to just run as parallel as possible at the driver level and make 32
"groups" of just one core to throw the 84 tasks at. This is easily done by
setting ``nCoresPerGroup 1`` in the ``ElasticTensor`` block. Putting everything
together we should add the following to our input file in order to optimally
utilize our machine for this example calculation::

   NumericalDifferentiation
      Parallel
         nGroups 4
      End
   End

   ElasticTensor
      Parallel
         nCoresPerGroup 1
      End
   End

Python interface
================

There is a complete Python interface to AMS, which allows users to set up and
run arbitrary AMS jobs, and to conveniently analyze the calculation results
directly from Python. In this way AMS jobs can be automatized and complex
multi-stage workflows implemented.

The scripting framework is called `PLAMS <../plams/index.html>`__ as in "Python
Library for Automating Molecular Simulation", which conveniently can also be
read as "Python Layer for AMS". It is documented in a separate manual:

* `PLAMS introduction <../plams/intro.html>`__
* `Running AMS through PLAMS <../plams/interfaces/amssuite.html>`__


.. index:: Pipe interface
.. index:: AMSPipe
.. _AMSPipe:

Pipe interface
==============

AMS can interact with other programs using a :ref:`custom communication protocol<PipeProtocol>`.
This enables two independent processes to communicate over a pair of data pipes (FIFOs), exchanging data in a highly efficient manner.
One of the processes is the "pipe master", driving the calculation and sending the atoms, coordinates etc. to the other process to perform calculations.
The other process is the "pipe worker", receiving requests from the master, performing the requested calculations and returning the results such as energies and gradients.

For technical details on the AMSPipe protocol see:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Pipe_protocol

AMS as a pipe master
--------------------

The AMS driver can play the role of a pipe master, allowing users to combine the features of the AMS driver with potentials implemented in external programs.
Unlike a :ref:`traditional external engine<ExternalEngines>`, the overhead introduced by the pipe interface is entirely negligible, because the external program is only started once at the beginning of the run and all communication is handled by an efficient binary protocol instead of text files.
This mode is enabled by using ``Engine Pipe`` in the input for the master.

.. code-block:: none

   Engine Pipe
      WorkerCommand /path/to/pipe/worker
   EndEngine

.. scmautodoc:: pipe WorkerCommand
   :nosummary:

All calculations requested by the driver will then be forwarded over the pipe to the worker for processing.

.. note::

   AMS currently must be run in serial (``NSCM=1``) when serving as a pipe master.

A Python module implementing the worker side of the AMSPipe protocol is available in ``scm.amspipe``.
To facilitate interfacing with various existing computational engines, this module provides the ``ASEPipeWorker`` class.
This class can wrap any ASE calculator object and make it serve as a pipe worker.

.. code-block:: python

   calculator = ase.calculators.lj.LennardJones()
   # calculator.parameters = â€¦

   engine = scm.amspipe.ASEPipeWorker(calculator=calculator)
   engine.run()

.. seealso::

  :ref:`example Pipe_ASEWorker`

AMS as a pipe worker
--------------------

AMS can also serve as a pipe worker, allowing external drivers to take advantage of its :ref:`engines<engines>`.
This mode is enabled by using ``Task Pipe``.
No :ref:`SystemDefinition` is required on the input because the system will be supplied by the pipe master.

.. hint::

   For most users it will easiest to use this functionality through the new `AMSWorker class <../plams/interfaces/amsworker.html>`__ in the `PLAMS <../plams/index.html>`__ library. This class hides all the details of the underlying AMSPipe protocol and provides users an easy way to get very fast access to energies, gradients and other properties from any of the engines in the AMS driver. See the `respective page <../plams/interfaces/amsworker.html>`__ in the PLAMS manual for details.

.. seealso::

  :ref:`example Pipe_AMSonAMS`

Additionally AMS can also be driven through the `FlexMD <../Scripting/FlexMD/FlexMD.html>`__ library using ``AMSPipeForceJob``:

.. code-block:: python

   forcejob = AMSPipeForceJob(mdmol)
   forcejob.settings.engine = 'ReaxFF'
   forcejob.settings.engineSettings = { 'ForceField': 'Glycine.ff' }
