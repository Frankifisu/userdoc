===========================

**AMS driver** is the driver program of the Amsterdam Modeling Suite. The job of the AMS driver is to handle all changes in the simulated system's geometry, e.g. during a geometry optimization or molecular dynamics calculation, using the so-called :ref:`engines <engines>` like ADF or DFTB for the calculation of energies and forces.
