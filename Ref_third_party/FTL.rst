The Fortran Template Library (FTL)
----------------------------------

Description:
   The Fortran Template Library (FTL) is a general purpose library for Fortran 2003. Its intention is to bring all these nice things we take for granted in modern languages like Python and C++ to the Fortran world: Generic containers, versatile algorithms, easy string manipulation, and more. It is heavily inspired by C++'s standard library, especially the part that is commonly referred to as the Standard Template Library (STL).
