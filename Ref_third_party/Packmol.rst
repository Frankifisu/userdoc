Description: 
  Packing Optimization for Molecular Dynamics Simulations 

  Packmol (version of november 2016) is used to generate MD starting geometries.
  No changes have been made to the source code, and the version of the source code
  that we have used is included in $AMSHOME/Install/packmol-16.281.tar.gz (november 2016). 

  Packmol is executed as an (external) stand-alone command via the GUI.
