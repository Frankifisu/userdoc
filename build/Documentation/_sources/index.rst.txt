Scripting
*********

`Scripting <../Scripting/index.html>`__
 The Amsterdam Modeling Suite includes several scripting environments, each with a specific scope and purpose.

`PLAMS <../plams/index.html>`__
 PLAMS (Python Library for Automating Molecular Simulation) is a collection of tools that aim at providing powerful, flexible and easily extendable Python interface to molecular modeling programs.

`ParAMS <../params/index.html>`__
 ParAMS is a Python toolkit for the parameterization of AMS engines such as ReaxFF and DFTB.

`AMSConformers <../conformers/index.html>`__
 AMSConformers is a Python toolkit for the generation of conformers sets for molecules.

`pyZacros <../pyzacros/index.html>`__
 pyZacros is a Python interface to Zacros to simulate molecular phenomena on catalytic surfaces using an approach based on a kinetic Monte Carlo strategy.
