Microkinetics (MKMCXX)
######################

The AMSKinetics GUI module provides an graphical interface to set up microkinetics simulations via the `MKMCXX <https://www.mkmcxx.nl/>`__ program by **Filot, I.A.W., Zijlstra, B. and Hensen, E.J.M.**. The Microkinetics GUI module was developed by **Micha Davids**.

For a description of the **MKMCXX** program and an overview of the microkinetics method, we refer the reader to the following pages:

* `MKMCXX website <https://www.mkmcxx.nl/>`__
* `MKMCXX wiki <https://wiki.mkmcxx.nl/index.php/Main_Page>`__
* `Introduction to microkinetic modeling <https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/introduction-to-microkinetic-modeling>`__ by I.A.W. Filot

When you publish results in the scientific literature which were obtained with the MKMCXX program you should include the following reference:
