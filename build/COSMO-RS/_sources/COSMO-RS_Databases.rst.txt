ADFCRS-2018 Database
********************

The COSMO-RS Database ADFCRS-2018 contains 2560 compounds.
This database combines the COSMO-RS database ADFCRS-2010, the ionic liquid database ADFCRS-IL-2014, and some extra compounds.

Follow the `COSMO-RS GUI Tutorial on the COSMO-RS compound database <../Tutorials/COSMO-RS/The_COSMO-RS_compound_database.html>`__ for more information on how to download and install the zipped COSMO-RS Database ADFCRS-2018 `https://downloads.scm.com/Downloads/crs/ADFCRS-2018.zip <https://downloads.scm.com/Downloads/crs/ADFCRS-2018.zip>`__, and how to use it.

The database contains CAS Registry Numbers. CAS Registry Number is a Registered Trademark of the American Chemical Society.

ADFCRS-2010
-----------

The COSMO-RS Database ADFCRS-2010 contains 1892 compounds, mostly solvents and small molecules. This database consists of ADF COSMO result (.coskf) files, which are results of ADF quantum mechanical calculations using COSMO, with settings suitable for use in our COSMO-RS module. The geometries have been optimized with ADF. This database makes the COSMO-RS functionality much easier and faster (the time-consuming DFT step is already done ..) to use.

The starting point for this database was a database of structures made by Prof. Sandler's group at the University of Delaware. The work of the Sandler group is based in part on earlier work by the group of Prof. Liu at Virginia Technical University, reported in these papers:

Mullins, E.; Oldland, R.; Liu, Y.A.; Wang, S.; Sandler, S.I.; Chen, C.-C.; Zwolak, M.; Seavey, K.C. *Sigma-Profile Database for Using COSMO-Based Thermodynamic Methods.* `Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2006, 45 (12), 4389-4415. <https://doi.org/10.1021/ie060370h>`__

Eng. Chem. Res. 2008, 47 (5), 1707-1725. <https://doi.org/10.1021/ie0711022>`__ 

Phillips, K.L.; Sandler, S.I.; Greene, R.W.; Di Toro, D.M. *Quantum Mechanical Predictions of the Henry's Law Constants and Their Temperature Dependence for the 209 Polychlorinated Biphenyl Congeners.* `Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008, 42 (22), 8412-8418. <https://doi.org/10.1021/es800876w>`__ 

All structures in the database ADFCRS-2010 differ from those in the papers above, as they are the result of ADF geometry optimizations.

ADFCRS-IL-2014
--------------

Ionic liquids (ILs), usually consisting of a large organic cation and a small inorganic polyatomic anion,
have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their unique thermophysical properties.
The low vapor pressure and high conductivity of these molten salts combined with highly tunable properties,
have resulted in highly diverse applications across many different fields in chemistry,
materials science (battery electrolytes), chemical engineering (gas sorption and purification), and many more. 

The COSMO-RS ionic liquid database ADFCRS-IL-2014 contains 80 cations and 56 anions.
This ADFCRS-IL-2014 database consists of
ADF COSMO result (.coskf) files, from standard ADF quantum
mechanical calculations, as described in `COSMO-RS GUI Tutorial: COSMO result files <../Tutorials/COSMO-RS/COSMO_result_files.html>`__.

SCM gratefully acknowledges Prof. Zhigang Lei's research group (State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, China) for providing the ionic liquid database as well as the corresponding tutorial.
