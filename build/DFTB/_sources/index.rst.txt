DFTB Manual |release|
=====================

The DFTB engine implements Density Functional based Tight-Binding methods, which can be viewed as computationally very efficient approximations to density functional theory (DFT). As such it is a good engine for computationally fast calculations that still include quantum effects. It can be used for molecules and for systems of any periodicity (3D, 2D and 1D).
