Quild Manual 2019
=================

QUILD (Quantum-regions Interconnected by Local Descriptions) enables calculations for multi-level approaches.

.. warning::

   QUILD and this manual have not been updated since the 2019 release of the
   Amsterdam Modeling Suite. Many examples from this manual will likely not
   work in AMS2020 or later, where ADF has been integrated into the AMS driver. Some of
   the functionality of QUILD can be achieved using the new
   `Hybrid Engine <../Hybrid/index.html>`_ which has been added in AMS2020.
