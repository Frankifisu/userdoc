ReaxFF: gasphase H\ :sub:`2`\ O (low-level scripting version)
=============================================================

.. important::

    First go through the :ref:`ReaxFF_Gasphase_Water` tutorial. The current
    tutorial accomplishes the same goal in a different way, by using several
    functions from the params python library. For beginning ParAMS users, we
    recommend to follow the :ref:`previous tutorial <ReaxFF_Gasphase_Water>`.

In this example a ReaxFF force field *Water2017.ff* will be reparameterized to describe the H--OH bond dissociation energy with
with `ADF <../../ADF/index.html>`_ as the reference engine.
The workflow script is stored in ``$AMSHOME/scripting/scm/params/examples/ReaxFF_water/scripting_version/run.py``,
the complete script can also be viewed :ref:`below <scodereax>`.

The script covers the following steps:
  * Definition of a job collection entry in the job collection
  * Construction of the training set
  * Definition of an |EngineCollection| and the reference engine (DFT settings)
  * Calculation of the reference data
  * Parameterization with the |OptCMA|
  * Generation of plots to evaluate the performance of the newly found parameters

Complete Example Script
-----------------------

Located in ``$AMSHOME/scripting/scm/params/examples/ReaxFF_Water/run.py``

Copy the script to an empty folder, and run it with ``$AMSBIN/amspython run.py``.

It will produce a png file plot_results.png (see picture above).

Execute the script once again to clean up the example folder (deleting all files generated during the optimization).

Changing the Example Script
---------------------------

Based on the original script above, the user could try the following, in order to familiarize oneself with the ParAMS package:

* Add more structures to the job collection
* Fit other properties in addition to the PES
* Experiment with different :ref:`CMA settings <cmasettings>`, especially ``sigma`` and ``popsize``.
* Use a different reference engine
* Add external reference values to the training set, instead of calculating them
