Optimizers
==========

Optimizers change the parameters such that the value of the loss function is
minimized. ParAMS provides a base class wrapper for different optimization
algorithms, making the selection of this component open-ended. An optimizer
instance can be passed to the :ref:`Optimization` class, once everything else
is set up:

>>> o = CMAOptimizer()
>>> optimization = Optimization(jobcol, training_set, interface, o)
>>> optimization.optimize()

Currently, the following optimization algorithms are included:

    cmaes
    scipy
    nevergrad
    armc
    grid
    base
