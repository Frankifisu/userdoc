Experimental Features
=====================

.. warning::

  Functionality implemented here is considered incomplete because
    * it has not been fully implemented yet
    * it has not been tested thoroughly enough to be added to the main package
    * it might be too specific for the ParAMS package and might be removed in the future
    * the respective documentation might be incomplete (refer to the API sections when in doubt)

  In any case, proceed with caution.

All classes and functions in this chapter have to be
explicitly imported with ``from scm.params.experimental import *``.
