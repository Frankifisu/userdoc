.. _example Propanenitrile:

Example: The role of specifying the atom types
==============================================

Now we look at a Propanenitrile molecule, the QM region is highlighted.

We run this with and without specifying the atom types on input. In principle this makes a difference for the MM type for atom "C(3)" in the MM sub calculation on atoms 3,7,8, and 9. If specified it will be C_3 (as it is in the whole Propanenitrile molecule), but if not it will be guessed as C_R. In practice there is no effect for this calculation.

Let us have a look at the report generated by the example, that pretty much explains what is done
