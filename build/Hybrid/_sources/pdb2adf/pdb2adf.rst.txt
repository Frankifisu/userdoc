pdb2adf: transform PDB file to QMMM input file
##############################################

.. _metatag PDB2ADF: 

The pdb2adf utility program was written by Marcel Swart. 

Overview
********

General description
===================

Starting from the ADF2005.01 version the utility pdb2adf is available in the official release. Previously this utility could be found on the contributed software page.
Starting from AMS2020 the default is to make an amsified ADF input, which can not be used with previous versions.
One can get the old style input if the environment variable SCM_PDB2ADF is set to OLD (only to be used with ADF<=2019).
One can get the NEWQMMM style input input if the environment variable SCM_PDB2ADF is set to NEW (only to be used with ADF<=2019).

The pdb2adf utility was written to read a  `PDB file <http://www.pdb.org>`__, which contains the atomic coordinates of a protein structure, and transform it into an ADF inputfile, particularly for use with QMMM calculations. It can also be used for setting up a solvent shell around a solute molecule. 

The PDB files are generally used for protein structures, and are formatted according to certain rules, see:  `http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html <http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html>`__, and the part about the official PDB format below. 

For every residue/molecule present in the PDB file, there should be a fragment file available, either in the general AMS library ($AMSHOME/atomicdata/pdb2adf directory), or in the local directory where the pdb2adf program is being called. Fragment files in the local directory take higher priority than those in the general AMS library. The fragment files are formatted, based loosely on AMBER parameter files, and contain information about the residues; e.g., the atoms present, with their general and forcefield atomnames, atomic charges, connections to other atoms for creating their positions when not found on the PDB file, etc.; see part about fragment files below. Available in the AMS library are fragment files for amino acid residues, including those at the N- or C-terminal residue, three solvents (water, methanol, chloroform), some ions that are present frequently in protein structures (copper, fluoride), etc. 

Also present in the AMS library are solvent box files that can be used to place a layer of solvents surrounding the protein, or a solute. Available are the three solvents mentioned above. 

After reading the PDB and corresponding fragment files, the program tries to figure out which atoms are missing, and will add those; it uses the information provided on the fragment files to do so. For certain amino acid residues, there are several protonation states possible, e.g. histidine can be protonated at the N-delta position, at the N-epsilon position, or on both. The default option is to choose the fully charged option for aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), lysine (Lys) residues, and decide for each histidine (His) and cysteine (Cys) residue individually what the protonation state should be. In those individual cases, the distances of neighboring molecules/residues are given that may help determine the protonation state. See the protein example below. 

After all that is setup properly, a list is given with residue names/numbers, from which you can choose those that should be placed in the QM system; afterwards, for each of the selected QM residues, a choice should be made where to cut-off the QM part. The most appropriate point to cut-off seems to be at the C-alpha position, except when dealing with a proline (Pro). The latter residue is cyclic, e.g. the sidechain is connected to the C-alpha carbon ! For that residue, it may be better to include the C-alpha, H-alpha, and backbone carbonyl group of the preceding residue in the QM part. 

The program will try to use to replace the ".pdb" extension of the PDB file by ".pdb2adf" for the AMS inputfile to be made; for convenience, the program also writes out an ".p2a.pdb" file with the complete system as it being made by the program. This file can then be visualized by conventional viewer programs (such as iMol, VMD, Molekel, AMSview) for visual inspection if everything has been carried out correctly. 

Given below are two examples, one for the application of a protein, the other how to set up a solvent shell run. 

Things to notice
================

+ The QMMM implementation in AMS2020 is new. It uses the AMS Hybrid engine.

+ By default pdb2adf makes an AMS Hybrid Engine input format.

+ The pdb2adf program uses AMBER parameter files, and is setup to work with the AMBER force field, version AMBER95, which is designed for and works well for biosystems.

+ For questions, remarks, contact:  `support@scm.com <mailto:support@scm.com>`__.


For ADF<=2019 only:

+ The old style QMMM input format is used if the environment variable SCM_PDB2ADF is set to OLD.

+ The NEWQMMM style QMMM input format is used if the environment variable SCM_PDB2ADF is set to NEW.

The pdb2adf utility is flexible, and should be able to read most PDB files, even those with incomplete or erroneous line formats. From every ATOM/HETATM line, it tries to read: 

+  atom number 

+  atom name 

+  residuename 

+  chain identifier 

+  residue number 

+  X,Y,Z coordinates 

Hints for proper formatting: 

+  always group together atoms that belong to one residue

+  always give the atom name on columns 13-16

+  when specifying a chain-id use only letters (or a blank)

Contents of fragment file
=========================

Given below is the contents of the fragment file for water. The first line is a comment line, the only important parameter is the NOCONNECT keyword, which indicates that the program should not try to make any connections to other residues/molecules. Then follow three lines, that define the orientation in space of the residue; they are not used for general fragments, but are relevant and important for amino acid residues and DNA nucleotides. Finally, for each atom in the molecule, there should be a line with its number in the fragment; its name to be used in PDB files; the AMBER forcefield atomtype; a dummy atomname; connections and coordinates (bond, angle, dihedral angle) to other atoms in the molecule that can be used to give the position of the atom if it is not present in the PDB file; the atomic charge; and after the exclamation mark (!) the connections to other atoms in this fragment, or other fragments in case of amino acid residues/DNA nucleotides. The current version does not use the latter connections yet, but the next version will probably use them.

Contents of solvent box files
=============================

The first line is a comment line, followed by a line with the total number of atoms in the solvent box and the dimensions of the box (in Angstroms); then for each atom in the box, the atom name, which must match the PDB atomname, and the Cartesian coordinates, again in Angstroms.

Short description
=================

The program works interactively, and should be straightforwardly to use. However, for some of the stages in the output a short description is given below.

                            This program uses AMBER parameter files
                               see: http://amber.scripps.edu
   
   Do you want a logfile to be written (Y/n) ?

This option exists to create a logfile of what pdb2adf does. However, it should normally be used only for debugging purposes. 

::

   Ignoring atom on line: 
   ATOM    974   OH LYS A 128     -10.073 42.775 15.690 1.00 38.79     5AZU1065 

This is a warning that the atom on that particular line is ignored, should normally occur only few times  (less than ten). Depends also on how well the PDB file follows the PDB format rules. 

::

   Data Processed:
        Nat:       2519
       Nmol:        196
    NChains:          1

Information about what has been read on the PDB file: the total number of atoms (Nat), number of  molecules/residues (Nmol) and number of protein chains (Nchains). 

::

   Please wait, making connection tables

At this point, the connections between the atoms are being made by looking at atom distances. It may  take a while, depending on the size of the system. 

::

   Do you want to make separate files for each chain (Y/n) ?

You have the option to make different inputfiles for different protein chains, but you can also make  one inputfile for all of them together. 

::

   Found the following terminal amino acid residues : (C-term) 128 (N-term) 1 
   Do you want to use these as terminal residues (Y/n) ? 

Info is given about the C- and N-terminal residue of each chain. Reported for making sure they are  chosen correctly. Note, if the C- and N-terminal residues are connected (rarely the case probably),  enter N here.

     2   HIE   Histidine Epsilon Hydrogen
     3   HIP   Histidine E & D Hydrogens
   
   Suggested option: 0

For a number of residues (His, Glu, Asp, Lys and Cys) there is more than one option available in the  AMBER95 force field, depending on the protonation state (His, Glu, Asp and Lys) or the existence of a  sulphur bridge/connection to a metal atom (Cys). The default is to choose a different option for the His  and Cys residues, and use one option for Glu, Asp and Lys (fully charged). However, if wanted you can  make a choice for all residues.

The options for Cys3 are given, with information about the atoms bonded to the SG sulphur atom (on  the left), as well as the closest five non-bonded atoms (on the right). This information may help you  decide which choice to make for this particular residue. Also given (on the bottom) is the suggested  choice, which is based, in this case, on the presence of a sulphur bridge.

   Suggestion: 2

For His residues, the information is given for both the delta- and the epsilon nitrogen atoms. Also  indicated (by HB) is the presence of a hydrogen bond with another atom. The definition used here is  that two atoms are hydrogen bonded if they are both non-carbon/non-hydrogen atoms, and the  distance between them is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the atoms. It is a simple  definition, but seems to be effective. In this case, as the N(delta) is bonded to copper, the proton  should be attached to the N(epsilon).

   Normal ending of PDB2ADF program
   ================================

ADF inputfile(s) have been written, the PDB-file has been processes. Everything is done. 

An example on protein structure
===============================

The idea of this example is to make an adf-input file using a PDB of an azurin (:download:`1DYZ.pdb.txt <1DYZ.pdb.txt>`). The result of this example should be that in the adf-input file the active site of azurin (Figure 1) is in the QM part, and the rest of the protein is in the MM part, and that the solvent water is added (in a box), which is also in the MM part.

An example on solvent shell run
===============================

The idea of this example is to make an adf-input file using a PDB file of water (:download:`hoh.pdb.txt <hoh.pdb.txt>`), in the solvent methanol. The water molecule in the adf-input file should be in the QM part, and the solvent methanol (in a box) is in MM part.
