MacOS Quickstart Guide
######################

This quickstart guide is for installing AMS on an Apple MacOS machine. Please also read the :ref:`generic Installation manual <metatag INSTRUCTIONS>` if you encounter problems.

**Start with downloading AMS2021 for MacOS** from the `main download page <http://www.scm.com/support/downloads/>`__ (click the orange *Download* button below the grey Apple logo), and save it on your computer. Open ams2021.101.macintel64.openmpi.dmg after the download is complete. Newer versions of AMS will have a different number in the file name.

Drag the AMS application (called AMS20XXX) from the disk image to your disk, for example by dropping it on the icon of the Applications folder in the disk image.

Important: the folder in which you store the AMS application should not contain spaces in its name (or in the names of any of its parent folders)! 

Installing in the standard /Applications folder should work fine.

The AMS package needs a valid license file to run. 

Double click the AMS20XXX application.

On MacOS Catalina when you open AMS20XXX for the first time from your Applications, you’ll see a notice “AMS20XXX can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software”. To Fix this

* In the Finder on your Mac, locate the app you want to open.
* Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu. 
* Click Open.

The app is then saved as an exception, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it or open it from your Applications on the Dock.

If you have no valid license a window will appear that allows you to request and install a license file. 
If a license file is available for you it will be installed automatically. 

Otherwise you will receive a mail when a license file is available. Double click the AMS20XXX application again and request a license again to install it. Note that you will never get more than one license for a particular machine, so no need to worry about requesting a license twice.
