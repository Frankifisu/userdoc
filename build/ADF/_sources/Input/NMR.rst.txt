NMR chemical shifts and NMR spin-spin couplings can be calculated. Effects due to spin-orbit coupling can be included. All electron basis sets can be used. 

The separate program EPR/NMR ($AMSBIN/epr) program is no longer documented, since most of its capabilities are implemented in newer modules. See the documentation of the EPR/NMR module in the `old ADF 2010 Properties document <http://downloads.scm.com/Doc/Doc2010/ADF/Properties/Properties.pdf>`_.

Worked out examples on chemical shift- and spin-spin-coupling calculations can be found in the **tutorials section**:

+ Chemical shifts and nuclear spin-spin coupling constants w. NBO analysis: `Analysis of NMR parameters with Localized Molecular Orbitals <../../Tutorials/NMR/NMRAnalysisWithNLMOAndNBO.html>`_ 
+ Chemical shifts and nuclear spin-spin coupling constants w. visualization of the spectrum in the GUI: `H-NMR spectrum with spin-spin coupling <../../Tutorials/NMR/H-NMRSpectrumSpin-SpinCoupling.html>`_
