SFO Populations
===============

In the section that prints the SFO populations of (selected) MOs you may occasionally find, for some SFOs in some MOs, *negative* SFO contributions. This may seem unphysical and hence suspicious, but it is 'only' a result of the Mulliken-type analysis method that underlies the computation of the SFO contributions. See the section below that discusses the output file. Likewise for larger-than-100% contributions: don't worry too much, these numbers may be correct (mathematically, given the Mulliken population formulas).
