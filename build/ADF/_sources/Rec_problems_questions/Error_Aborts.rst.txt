Error Aborts
============

The program performs a large number of checks during the calculation and may stop when it detects and error. It is close to impossible to show here a complete list of all possible error messages. In a large number of cases, additional information is printed in the output file to provide a clue as to the cause of the error. It is always useful to carefully inspect the printed info and to try to understand the meaning of any error- or warning messages. If you can't find your way out, try to get help from your ADF provider. If that fails, contact us directly at support@scm.com
