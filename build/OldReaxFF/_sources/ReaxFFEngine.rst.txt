ReaxFF as an AMS engine
=======================

The ReaxFF AMS engine enables efficient parallel calculations using this parametrized reactive molecular mechanics potential. The engine shares all core routines with the :doc:`standalone ReaxFF program <index>`, guaranteeing identical energies and forces between these two codes.

For more information, see the `ReaxFF Engine manual <../ReaxFF/index.html>`__.
