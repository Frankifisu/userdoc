`RDKit <https://www.rdkit.org>`_ is a collection of cheminformatics and machine-learning software written in C++ and Python.
PLAMS interface to RDKit originates from `QMFlows <https://github.com/SCM-NV/qmflows>`_ project and features functions for generating PLAMS molecules from string representations (SMARTS, SMILES) as well as a handful of tools for dealing with proteins and PDB files.
