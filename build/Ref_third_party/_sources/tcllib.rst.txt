      In response to popular demand, the Tcl core group is introducing tcllib, 
      a Tcl standard library. This meta-package will contain many modules, 
      each of which is itself a standalone Tcl package. The intention is to 
      provide commonly used functions and libraries, bundled together under a 
      single license (BSD), and with no binary dependencies.

   The following text is included with both the tcllib and tklib distributions in license.terms:
