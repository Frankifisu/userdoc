##############################

This section contains tutorials that show you how to use Quantum ESPRESSO or VASP via the GUI. 

If you are not familiar with the graphical user interface (GUI) in the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, please have a look at the  :ref:`Introduction<Introduction>` and  :ref:`GUI Overview<GUI>` tutorials. 
The :ref:`Building Crystals and Slabs<CRYSTALBUILDING>` tutorial is especially important for these tutorials. 


**Quantum espresso**

.. _QE: 

When you start AMSinput and switch to the Quantum ESPRESSO section, AMSinput will check if 
Quantum ESPRESSO is installed in such a way that the  GUI can use it. If not it will give you the option to download Quantum ESPRESSO binaries and pseudopotentials
from the SCM web site and install them automatically. Obviously you need a connection to the internet for this feature to work.

.. Note::

  To use Quantum ESPRESSO with the GUI it must be added to your license file

For more details see the `Set up <../../GUI/Set_up.html#quantum-espresso>`__  section in the GUI manual.
