Keyboard shortcuts
******************

Some `keyboard shortcuts <../../GUI/Keyboard_shortcuts.html>`__ for menu commands used in the tutorials are platform specific. For example: 

+ Undo: ctrl-Z on Linux/Windows, cmd-Z on Macintosh

+ Save: ctrl-S on Linux/Windows, cmd-S on Macintosh

In general, on Linux and Windows machines use the ctrl key to access these shortcuts for the menu commands, on a Mac use the cmd key. In the tutorials, these command keys may be mentioned as for example cmd/ctrl-S 

A three-button mouse is also very convenient for using the AMS-GUI, and on a Mac you can use a Magic mouse for this purpose.
