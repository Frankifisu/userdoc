Python scripting with COSMO-RS using the PLAMS library
******************************************************

`The PLAMS library <../../plams/index.html>`__ can be used to run COSMO-RS jobs from a python environment.  This is the easiest way to set up high-throughput jobs or complex workflows with COSMO-RS.  All COSMO-RS jobs can be run from python, and all results can easily and directly be accessed as a python object.  

`The tutorial for scripting with PLAMS and COSMO-RS <../../COSMO-RS/PLAMS_COSMO-RS_scripting.html>`__ is located in the COSMO-RS documentation and can be accessed by clicking on the link at the beginning of this sentence.  More technical information about the COSMO-RS interface is available in `the COSMO-RS PLAMS documentation <../../plams/interfaces/crs.html>`__ 

.. attention:: Windows and Mac users may find it helpful to first read the *Getting Started* guides for scripting: 
    `scripting with Windows <../../Scripting/GettingStarted.html#windows>`__
    | `scripting with MacOS <../../Scripting/GettingStarted.html#macos>`__
