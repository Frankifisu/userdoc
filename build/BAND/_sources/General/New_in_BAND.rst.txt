What's new in Band 2022.1
*************************
* Mulliken analysis (including PDOS) with spin-orbit coupling
* Alternative elements (model impurities, fractional site occupancies)
* Electron energy density function
* Fermi surface

What's new in Band 2021.1
*************************

* The :ref:`D4(EEQ) dispersion correction <GrimmeD4>` can now be used for periodic systems.
* :ref:`r2SCAN-D4 <LIBXC>` XC functional
* New `AMS driver <../../AMS/index.html>`__ features can be used in combination with BAND. See the page `What's new in the AMS driver <../../AMS/General.html#what-s-new-in-the-ams-driver>`__  for more details.


What's new in Band 2020
***********************

* New default: :ref:`Scalar relativistic ZORA <relativistic_effects>` is now enabled by default (in previous versions "non-relativistic" was the default).
* :ref:`Basis sets for Uue (Z=119) and Ubn (Z=120) added<basis set>`
* BAND can be used in QM/MM calculations with the new Hybrid Engine. See the `Hybrid Engine manual <../../Hybrid/index.html>`__ and `tutorial <../../Tutorials/StructureAndReactivity/HybridMechanicalEmbedding.html>`__ for more details.
* New `AMS driver <../../AMS/index.html>`__ features can be used in combination with BAND. See the page `What's new in the AMS2020 driver <../../AMS/General.html#what-s-new-in-the-ams2020-driver>`__  for more details (particularly important for BAND are the new strain-constraints and the periodic geometry optimizer improvements).
