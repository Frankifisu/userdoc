General
*******

AMSpackages is a GUI module that can be used to install optional software components.
Users of the graphical user interface will automatically be prompted to install an optional component when the option is selected in AMSInput.
Alternatively they can use SCMMenu **â†’** Packages to install packages at any time.
The graphical interface can also be started using :code:`"${AMSBIN}/AMSpackages" gui` on the command line.
