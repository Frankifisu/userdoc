The GFN-FF generic force field was added in AMS2022. It does not require any external force-field file because all parameters are built into GFN-FF. 
GFN-FF covers a full-periodic-table parameterization for elements up to radon (Z=86). 
The current implementation runs on a single processor only and it should be able to treat systems up to several thousand atoms.
