How to call the program
#######################

The QUILD program is available in the general 2009.01 release of ADF, and should be called in similar fashion as ADF, e.g. 

::

   #! /bin/sh
   
   $AMSBIN/quild << eor
   ! Normal ADF input, maybe extended with a QUILD inputblock (see below)
   eor

The user is responsible for the installation of external programs such as ORCA, MOPAC or a GENERIC program. For the use of ORCA, the user should make sure that the following works: 

::

   orca quildjob.1.inp

and gives the corresponding quildjob.1.engrad file. 

For the use with MOPAC the 2009 version of Mopac is needed (see  `http://openmopac.net) <http://openmopac.net>`__, and SCM_MOPAC should be set to the location where MOPAC is installed. The first line of the MOPAC subblock should contain the AUX(0) directive, as in the following example: 

::

   DESCRIPTION 3 MOPAC
     AUX(0) BONDS CHARGE=0  SCFCRT=1.0D-8 PM3 1SCF GRAD
     Coordinates generated by AMSinput (c) SCM 1998-2008
   SUBEND

Finally, note that the MOPAC subblock should contain 2 lines ! 

For the use of QUILD with a GENERIC program, the input is straightforward: 

::

   DESCRIPTION 3 GENERIC
     ! Here the specific input for the user-provided GENERIC program
   SUBEND

It should be noted that by default, QUILD will use $AMSBIN/quild_generic as script for use with the GENERIC subblock (this example script facilitates the use of HONDO). However, this can be overridden by setting the environment variable $QUILD_GENERIC to a user-provided script (see also the  :ref:`GENERIC<GENERIC>` description).
