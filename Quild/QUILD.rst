####################################################

The QUILD (*Quantum-regions Interconnected by Local Descriptions*) program [:ref:`1-2<reference 1>`] has been developed by  M. Swart and F. M. Bickelhaupt for enabling calculations through multi-level approaches, in which different computational treatments are used for different regions of the system under study. M.
