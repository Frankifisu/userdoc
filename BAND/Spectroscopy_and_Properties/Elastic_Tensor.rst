Elastic Tensor
**************

The elastic tensor (and related elastic properties such as Bulk modulus, Shear modulus and Young modulus) can be computed via numerical differentiation by AMS. See the `Elastic Tensor section of the AMS manual <../../AMS/Properties.html#elastic-tensor>`__.

When calculating the elastic tensors using Band one should disable :ref:`Symmetry <band-key-UseSymmetry>`.
