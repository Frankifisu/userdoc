Frequencies and Phonons
***********************

Frequencies and Phonons and can be computed via numerical differentiation by the AMS diver. See the `Normal Modes section <../../AMS/Properties.html#normal-modes-hessian>`__ or the `Phonon section of the AMS manual <../../AMS/Properties.html#phonons>`__.

Several thermodynamic properties, such as Zero-point Energy, Internal Energy, Entropy, Free Energy and Specific Heat are computed by default when calculating Phonons.
