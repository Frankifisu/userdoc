ReaxFF Manual |release|
=======================

ReaxFF is an engine for modeling chemical reactions with atomistic
potentials based on the reactive force field approach developed by Prof.
Adri van Duin and coworkers. SCM has modernized, parallelized and greatly
optimized the original ReaxFF program. 

Before AMS2018, ReaxFF was run as a standalone program. Starting from
AMS2018, ReaxFF is an engine for the AMS driver, thus sharing many of the
features and input syntax with the other engines in the Amsterdam
Modeling Suite.  For more information, see :ref:`enginevsstandalone`.
