      **WARNING**: This manual described the old standalone ReaxFF program, which will be removed from a future release of the Amsterdam Modeling Suite. If possible, use `ReaxFF as an AMS engine <../ReaxFF/index.html>`__ instead.

      ReaxFF is a tool for modeling chemical reactions with atomistic potentials based on the reactive force field approach developed by Prof. Adri van Duin and coworkers. SCM has modernized, parallelized and greatly optimized the original Reax program but kept it input- and output-compatible with the original, with some extensions.
