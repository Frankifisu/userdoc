What's new in ReaxFF 2019
*************************

ReaxFF is available in the `AMS driver <../AMS/index.html>`__ as one of
the engines, which means that all tasks that can be performed with the AMS
driver are also available for ReaxFF. However, not all tasks available in the
classic ReaxFF standalone program have already been ported to AMS, so in the
2019 release of the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, the standalone ReaxFF program and
the ReaxFF engine coexist. This manual mostly describes the standalone ReaxFF
program. For documentation on how to use ReaxFF in AMS, see the special page on
:ref:`ReaxFF as an AMS engine<ReaxFFEngine>` as well as the `AMS driver manual
<../AMS/index.html>`__.

Development of the *standalone* ReaxFF program has been stopped, so there are 
no new features in the 2019 version.
