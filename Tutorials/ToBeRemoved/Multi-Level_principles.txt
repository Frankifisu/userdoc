Multi-Level principles: Regions, QUILD, QMMM, Quality per region
****************************************************************

.. _MULTILEVEL: 

In this tutorial the basic concepts of setting up multi-level   calculations in the ADF-GUI will be demonstrated. In most cases   one would use a multi-level method for big systems: handle the   full system with a fast method, and use ADF to study a particular   region of interest with more detail. As big systems will take too   much time for a tutorial, the concepts will be shown with very   small toy systems that are not typical applications. 

Step 1: Regions for multi-level calculations, visualization and grouping
========================================================================

For all multi-level calculations you will need to define regions. 

Within AMSinput, **a region is a collection of   atoms**. You manage your regions with the 'Regions' panel   in AMSinput. It allows you to define new regions, modify existing   regions, and to apply some commands on particular regions. 

As a first example, we will work with an acetone molecule   (CH3COCH3) to demonstrate how to use QUILD. 

Generate regions
----------------

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Start AMSinput, and build an Acetone molecule (or search for it... using |Search|)
    | Select one of the methyl groups
    | Use the panel bar **Model → Regions** command
    | Click on the '+' button to add a new region
    | Change the name 'Region_1' into 'Methyl' (the label is editable)

.. image:: /Images/tadf/methylregion.png

You have just defined a new region, with a name 'Methyl'. In your   molecule window you can see what atoms are part of this region: they are highlighted with semi-transparent spheres. Note that   there are now (at least) two regions define: the region that you   defined, and a region called 'All' that is always present. Obviously, the All region includes all atoms. If you created the acetone molecule via the search command, you may have a third region that was automatically made. 

Now we will define yet another region: the rest of the molecule. One way to do this is just to select the atoms that should be part of it, and pressing the '+' button as you did before. However, to demonstrate some of the things you can do with regions we will do it in another way: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Make sure you have only the All and the Methyl region; if you have more, press the '-' button in front of the region
    | Click the check button in the 'All' region (this the button like a V on the right side, to select all atoms in this region)
    | Click the '+' button to create a new region, as you did before
    | Click the check button in the 'Methyl' region (again the V like button to select all atoms in this region)
    | Click the '-' button in the 'Region_2' line, on the right-hand side

.. image:: /Images/tadf/allregions.png

Basically, what you just did: select all atoms, make a new region containing all atoms, select the atoms in the Methyl region, remove the selected atoms from the new region. By clicking on the select buttons in the regions you can easily verify that your regions are now as they should be. 

.. tip::

    Shortcut to quickly generate a new region containing the selection: **Atoms → New Region From Selected Atoms**, or cmd/ctrl - G. 

Visualization options per region
--------------------------------

You can easily change what regions, and atoms within that region   look like: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Click in empty (drawing) space to clear the selection
    | Click in the check box in front of the 'Methyl' region name to uncheck it

You should observe that the ghost-like region visualization   disappears. Please turn it back on: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Click in the check box in front of the 'Methyl' region name to check it
    | Click on the right arrow at the end of the 'Region_2' line
    | Use the 'Sticks' command from the menu that appears

.. image:: /Images/tadf/sticks.png

Now anything in 'Region_2' will be visualized as sticks only.   Obviously you could also select any of the other display options. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Click on the right arrow at the end of the 'Region_2' line
    | Use the 'Balls & Sticks' command from the menu that appears

Using regions to group molecules for editing
--------------------------------------------

You can use regions to group atoms together for editing. When   changing the distance, angle or dihedral using the slider atoms   that are in one region move together. 

As an example, lets break the aceton molecule into three   fragments by deleting the C-C bonds: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Delete the CC bonds

.. image:: /Images/tadf/t8-acetone-broken.png

Note that one CH3 fragment and the CO group are still together in   one region, and the other CH3 group is in its own region. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Select the C from the CO group and the C from the CH3 group that is in a different region
    | (use shift-click on an atom to add atoms to the selection)

.. image:: /Images/tadf/t8-acetone-slider.png

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Use the slider to change the distance between the selected carbons

Note that the CO group and the CH3 group in the same region move   together, thus the regions act as a tool to group things together   for editing (with the slider). This grouping also works when you   want to change an angle using the slider. 

To prepare for the next step of the tutorial, undo the changes   you made in this step using the Undo function repeatedly: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Undo until the C-C bonds are present again
    | Make sure Balls & Sticks are used as visualization style

Step 2: QUILD
=============

Once you have defined your regions, it is easy to set up the   QUILD calculation: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Use the panel bar **ADF → Quild** menu to select the Quild panel
    | Click the '+' button to add an action
    | Click the '+' button to add a second action
    | In the first action, select DFTB in the 'Use' field
    | In the second action, select ADF in the 'Use' field

.. image:: /Images/tadf/quild.png

The first action ('Total') defines what to do with the full   molecule. It normally will apply to the entire molecule, and thus   the 'All' region is preselected. In the 'Use' field you have   specified how to treat the whole molecule: with DFTB. 

The second action ('Replace') tells QUILD to replace the DFTB   result for the selected region with results from another method.   The region for which we want to do this is the 'Methyl' region,   and it happens to be automatically selected. You can use the region pull-down menu to select another region, and it   offers you a short-cut to make a new region. 

In the 'Use' field of the second action you have selected what to   use as a replacement method: ADF. 

In the 'Remove' field it should be specified that you wish to   remove the DFTB results for this region. 
AMSinput will enter this   automatically when you save your job. You can also set it   manually if you wish. 

The Quild panel offers you to set some details for the QUILD   calculation. The defaults should work fine. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Save your set up (this will make a fourth tab corresponding to the Remove field, called DFTB2)

Four tabs can be found at the bottom of the Quild panel: 'Quild',   'DFTB 1', 'ADF 1' and 'DFTB 2'. These tabs allow you to set up   the different parts of the calculation. Right now you could make   adjustments of the global QUILD settings. If you press on the   'ADF 1' tab, you will have the option to set the details of the   ADF calculation (for the 'Methyl' region). And if you click on   the 'DFTB 1' tab you can set up details of the DFTB part of the   calculation. The 'DFTB 2' tab is the DFTB calculation on the   'Methyl' group that will be removed from the full system.   Normally the set up for this calculation is identical to the full   system (DFTB 1), but in some special cases you will need to   modify it. See the QUILD manual for details. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Click on the 'ADF 1' tab
    | Look through the different panels, to see what options ADF will use. Do NOT make changes! 
    | Click on the 'DFTB 1' tab
    | Select the DFTB.org/3ob-3-1 parameter set 
    | Click on the 'DFTB 2' tab
    | Select the DFTB.org/3ob-3-1 parameter set 
    | Click on the 'Quild' tab
    | Save your set up


Now let's run this calculation: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | **File → Run**
    | Click 'No' when asked to update the geometry

When your calculation is finished you can view the resulting   optimization using AMSmovie: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Use the **SCM → Movie** command
    | Add a second graph: **Graph → Add Graph**
    | 
    | Show the energy of the ADF-subsystem on the second graph:
    | **Graph → Quild Energies → job 2 : ADF ...**

.. image:: /Images/tadf/quildmovie.png

You can also open the output file using the **SCM →   Output** command. The other visualization tools can not be   applied to the full QUILD results, but they can be used to   examine the result of the ADF calculation (on the Methyl region).   This is done in quildjob.2: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Show the AMSjobs window
    | Show the QUILD job details (click on the triangle to show the details)

.. image:: /Images/tadf/quildfiles.png

Using the View menu command you will try to open the .t21 result   file for the QUILD job. That will not work, we need to view only   the .t21 file of the adf sub-system. To do this, we first open   this result file in the KFBrowser. This tool allows you to   inspect details of the binary KF files. Next, use the View   command in the SCM menu of the KFBrowser to open that specific   file in AMSview: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Double-click on the .results/quildjob.2.t21 file
    | In the KFBrowser window, **SCM → View**
    | Visualize the HOMO in AMSview
    | Click on the Isosurface: With Phase pull-down menu and use the Show Details command
    | Change the Opacity to 70 

.. image:: /Images/tadf/quildhomo.png

Note that QUILD has added a dummy hydrogen to cap the broken   bond. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Go to AMSjobs window
    | Select (click once) on the quildjob.2.t21 file in the QUILD job details
    | **SCM → Levels**

.. image:: /Images/tadf/quildlevels.png

Note that the commands from the SCM menu typically work on the selected file.
Now you have the ADF result file for the methyl group visible in   AMSview and AMSlevels. With AMSview and AMSlevels you can examine   the ADF results as usual. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | **SCM → Quit All**

Step 3: QMMM
============

Generate ethanol in water
-------------------------

To demonstrate how to set up a QM/MM calculation using AMSinput,   we will use ethanol in water as an example. This will also show   you how to add explicit solvent molecules to your system: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Start AMSinput
    | Build an ethanol molecule
    | Pre-optimize the structure
    | **Edit → Solvent Molecules...**
    | Change the radius of the solvent sphere to a small value,
    | such that 10 solvent molecules will be generated
    | Click on 'Add Solvent'

.. image:: /Images/tadf/solventregs.png

As you can see, AMSinput has generated 10 water molecules around   your ethanol molecule. It also has created two regions: a Solute   region containing the ethanol molecule, and a Solvent region   containing the water molecules. The visualization option for the   Solvent region is such that the water molecules will only be   shown using a Wire-frame representation. 

Set up the QM/MM calculation
----------------------------

The next step is to set up the QM/MM calculation: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | **ADF → QMMM**: select the 'QMMM' panel
    | Select the 'Solute' region in the 'QM Region' pull-down menu
    | Change the QMMM Task to **Geometry Optimization**

.. image:: /Images/tadf/qmmmsetup.png

Now you will have three tabs: the main QMMM tab that allows you   to set QMMM details, the 'ADF 1' tab that is the setup for the   ADF calculation for the Solute subsystem, and the 'MM 5' tab that   sets up the MM calculation for the full system. 

AMSinput is currently not very smart in setting the proper atom   types for a MM calculation. So you will need to examine the atom   types as they are generated in the MM input, and fix them if they   are not correct. To fix this, if needed, use the Atom Inspector   panel to set the Tripos (or Amber) atom types as needed. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Click on the 'MM 5' tab
    | Activate the 'Run Script' panel (in the panel bar Details, click OK to acknowledge the warnings twice)
    | Check the atom types (in the run script)

Run the QMMM calculation, and see results
-----------------------------------------

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Run your calculation **File → Run**
    | Show the optimization movie: 
    | In the AMSinput window: **SCM → Movie**

.. image:: /Images/tadf/qmmmmovie.png

Note that AMSmovie (and the other GUI modules) will only show the   results for the QM part of your calculation. 

To get detailed information on your QMMM calculation, you can   check the output file using the **SCM → Output**   command. 

Step 4: DRF
===========

Introduction
------------

To demonstrate how to set up a DIM/QM DRF calculation using AMSinput, we will use water in water as an example.
DRF is a QM/MM method in which the MM atoms interact with the QM region via induced dipoles and static charges.
DRF facilitates calculating the optical properties of molecules, in this case we will look at the solvent effect on excitation energies.
Note that the geometry optimizations are not possible with DRF in ADF.

Gas phase excitation energies
-----------------------------

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Start AMSinput
    | Build a water molecule
    | Pre-optimize the structure
    | Use the ADF panel
    | Select the **Single Point** task
    | Use the panel bar **Properties → Excitations (UV/Vis), CD** command
    | For the 'Type of excitations' option, Select 'SingletOnly'
    | Save as 'Water'
    | **File → Run**

Solvent effects excitation energies using DRF
---------------------------------------------

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | **Edit → Solvent Molecules...**
    | Change the radius of the solvent sphere to a value,
    | such that approximately 130 solvent molecules will be generated
    | Click on 'Add Solvent'
    | Use the panel bar **Model → DIM/QM** command
    | For the 'Method' option, Select 'DRF'
    | Click the check button 'QM part' for the Solute region
    | Click the check button 'DIM part' for the Solvent region

In the next step atomic charges for the DRF region are computed using MDC-Q charges (LDA functional, DZP basis set).
The atomic polarizabilities are taken from a inner database including H, C, N, O, F, S, Cl, Br, I atoms.

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | For the 'Select charges' option, Select 'MDC-Q'
    | Save as 'Water_DRF'
    | **File → Run**

.. image:: /Images/tadf/drfinput.png

See the results
---------------

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | When the calculation is ready, select both the Water_DRF and the Water job in AMSjobs
    | Open AMSspectra: **SCM → Spectra** command
    | **Axes → Horizontal Unit → eV**

.. image:: /Images/tadf/drfspectra.png
  
Note that having two jobs selected in AMSjobs opens both jobs in the same AMSspectra window.
That is easy to compare results.

Alternatively (with the same result), open AMSspectra for one of the jobs, and use the Add command in the File menu. 


Step 5: Quality per region
==========================

Another method to handle bigger systems is to calculate part of   your system as you would normally do, and another part that   further away of the region of interest with a lower numerical   accuracy, and/or smaller basis sets. As an example how to set   this up we will use the same ethanol - water solvent system that   was used for the QM/MM tutorial in the previous step. 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Start AMSinput
    | Build an ethanol molecule
    | Pre-optimize the structure
    | **Edit → Solvent Molecules...**
    | Change the radius of the solvent sphere to a small value,
    | such that 10 solvent molecules will be generated
    | Click on 'Add Solvent'

.. image:: /Images/tadf/solventregs.png

Note that your system consists of two regions: the Solute and the   Solvent region. 

The next step is to set up the calculation parameters: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Select the **Geometry Optimization** task
    | Use the |MoreBtn| button on the "Numerical Quality" line

.. image:: /Images/tadf/t8-numerical.png

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | For the Solvent region:
    | change the Becke integration to Basic
    | change the Spline Zlm fit to Basic
    | change the Basis quality to SZ

.. image:: /Images/tadf/t8-numerical-adjusted.png

Next run the calculation and see a movie of the results: 

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | Run your calculation **File → Run**, save with a name you like
    | Show the optimization movie (while the job is still running):
    | In the AMSinput window: **SCM → Movie**

.. image:: /Images/tadf/t8-quality-per-region.png

Note that now you will see the full system, in contrast with the QM/MM results. 
As the gradient convergence information is available from the logfile, AMSmovie will automatically show not only the Energy curve, but also the gradient convergence curves.

Depending on your exact starting geometry the optimization may need many cycles.
As this is just a tutorial, there is no point in waiting for it.
So you may just kill it:

.. rst-class:: steps

  \ 
    | In AMSjobs select your job
    | If it is still running: **Job → Kill**
