Multiscale modeling of OLED devices
***********************************

Introduction
------------

Intro: integrated modeling pipeline from the individual molecule (`SCM <https://scm.com>`__) to OLED device (`Simbeyond <https://simbeyond.com>`__).

This tutorial teaches you to:

* Deposit a thin film of your material in a simulated physical vapor deposition.
* Calculate the distribution of properties such as ionization potential, electron affinity and exciton energies for all molecules in the film.
* Transfer the data to Simbeyond's `Bumblebee <https://simbeyond.com/bumblebee>`__ code for OLED device simulations involving your material.

Done for two example compounds here:

* `Alq3 <https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16683111>`__ as a versatile electron injection and transport layer, as well as blue (fac-Alq3) and green (mer-Alq3) emitter.
* `alpha-NPD <https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/58918517>`__ as a common hole transport material.
