Example: Using capping atoms in a periodic system
=================================================

Here we look at a  polyethylene-like (infinite) chain, the carbons being alternatingly substituted with B and N atoms.

We will use a bunch of different QM systems in a QMMM setup, and check what happens. Inevitably we need to break B-N bonds, and hence capping atoms are used. (In the picture the QM region according to variant one is shown.)
We also show the results obtained for the system with the pure QM and MM methods.

Let us have a look at the report generated by the example, that pretty much explains what is done
